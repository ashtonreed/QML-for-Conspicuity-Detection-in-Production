### Project Solution:
This project focused on a series of PennyLane exercises and tutorials to become more experienced with machine learning. The PennyLane codebook exercises can be found [here](https://github.com/ashtonreed/QML-for-Conspicuity-Detection-in-Production/blob/main/Task1_Pennylane_Codebook.ipynb) while the Variational Classifier tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/ashtonreed/QML-for-Conspicuity-Detection-in-Production/blob/main/Task2_Variational_Classifier.ipynb) and the Quanvolutional Neural Network tutorial [here](https://github.com/ashtonreed/QML-for-Conspicuity-Detection-in-Production/blob/main/Task3_Quanvolutional_Neural_Network.ipynb).
